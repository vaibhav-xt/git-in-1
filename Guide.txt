Git is based on Unix based syntax.

Steps :-

1) Always First check\set username and user email to check type
	
	To Set :-
 
	i)  Name :- git config --global user.name (name)
	ii) Email :- git config --global user.email (name@gmail.com)

	To Check :-
	 
	i)  Name - git config --global user.name
	ii) Email - git config --global user.email

2) Now type " git init " to initialized empty repository 
3) " ls -lart " shows the hidden files in .git
4) " git status " to check status
5) Now to add to stage in Git file's like python or html or any file then type " git add (name of the file).
	[Note:- While adding the file must be in  the same directory] 
 
6) To Check git version then type "git --version"
7) To start any project we must commit it to file or to save (Initial Commit)
	Syntax :- git commit
		i)   After writing commit, Now if you write any text then add first write "Capital I" to insert
		ii)  After that, Here you can add message like "Initial Commit".
		iii) To Exit, then press Key :- first - Esc
						second - :
						third - w
						fourth - q
		Next Short Method To commit-
			i) First type "git commit -m ""(add message in inverted comma)"		


8) If we write " git status " it says that working tree clean (means its ok now can go for next step).

9) Now if you want to create any file using git bash then type txt " touch (name of the file) ". 
   Here touch is used to create new files.

10) Lets Say, You have more than thousand of file to add to stage then you cant do one by one which is very difficult.
    This time you can write the text " git add -A " it will add all the files

11) Must remember that you always check status because if there is any change in file then you get know immidiately.

12) If you want to clear terminal than type "clear". It clear the terminal.
